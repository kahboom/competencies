# React Competencies
Generally speaking, the goal should be to touch each part that comprises the core concepts of the framework.

Though relative, this is a general list of things you should probably familiarize yourself with in order to feel comfortable with the framework. Not all projects using React will need proficiency in these areas, but they would likely be beneficial to understand. Items marked with an asterisk are generally considered optional.

Please note, even if you don't use some of these approaches, it's important to still familiarize yourself with them before deciding on the right setup for your project. Each project will have unique needs.
